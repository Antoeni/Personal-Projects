# Nixie Tube Clock Documentation
Here is the documentation of how the project was created.

This project was heavily based on a youtuber's nixie tube clock.

## Process of Designing
First steps I started with creating a PCB which was essentially GreatScott's PCB but then retrofitted so that it fits with the parts that I have at hand.

After Completing the Schematic I then started with designing the PCB and placing them in the correct spots.

Here is the raw PCB without traces, copper layers added, and correct measurements or placement for the parts. 

This is what the PCB looks like after I have routed all of the traces.

After which I then added the copper layers for GND net and 5V net
